# Pipeline for Galaxy Surface Brightness Profile Fitting (Ji et al. 2018).

These subroutines are used in Ji et al. (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASP..130h4504J) for sky background estimation and galaxy surface brightness profile fit. The original codes used in the paper were written in Python 2, but the codes uploaded here are modified to be operational in Python 3.
